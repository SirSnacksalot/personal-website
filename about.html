		<h2>About Me </h2>
		<h3>I am a senior undergraduate student at MIT studying Computer Science &amp; Engineering as well as Comparative Media Studies.</h3>
		<h3>I was born in Mexico to two adoring parents. My father spent his entire life in Mexico, but my mother on the other hand traveled back and forth between there and Southern California as she grew up, so her English was very good while my dad's was lacking at the time when I was born. In order to become proficient in both languages my parents decided to each talk to me in one language, so since as early as I can remember, I've been speaking mostly Spanish with my dad and mostly English with my Mom. At the age of two years old, I moved to Southern California with my parents and began making memories. I fell in love with the natural world, television, movies, books, and with the act of climbing trees.</h3>
		<h3>Expanding the experience of life through stories and storytelling is my favorite thing to do, and computers have always helped me in conveying my thoughts and emotions into shareable mediums like video and music. I started writing stories with Microsoft Word when I was 7, and today I'm making short films with Adobe Premiere Pro. Thus, I figured I should double major in both the subject that deals with my artistic expression and the technology that makes this expression possible for me.</h3>
