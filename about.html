			<h2>About Me </h2>
			<h3>I'm a senior undergraduate student at MIT studying Comparative Media Studies (essentially Film Studies) as well as Computer Science &amp; Engineering.</h3>
			<h3>Although I grew up in Southern California, I was actually born in Mexico. In order to become proficient in both languages my parents decided to each talk to me in one language, so from as early as I can remember, I've been speaking mostly Spanish with my dad and mostly English with my Mom. At the age of two years old, I moved to Southern California with my parents and began making memories. I fell in love with the natural world, books, television, movies, and the climbing of trees.</h3>
			<h3>Expanding the experience of life through storytelling is my favorite thing to do, and computers have always helped me in conveying my thoughts and emotions into shareable mediums like video and music. I started writing stories with Microsoft Word when I was 7, and today I'm making short films with Adobe Premiere Pro. Thus, I figured I should double major in both the subject that deals with my artistic expression and the technology that makes this expression possible for me.</h3>
